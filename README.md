## My Qtile dotfiles ðŸ’™
I started using Linux in April 2022 and as soon as I discovered Tiling Window Managers there was no way back.<br>

After messing around with some WMs  like Awesome and Bspwm I was getting tired of copy / pasting config files and tweaking them into my needs.<br>

That was until I discovered Qtile which is fully written in python, main reason why I decided to stick with it since it's the language I'm most comfortable working with.<br>

After some time and effort I created my own Desktop Enviroment that fullfills all my needs just the way I want it.<br>

Isn't that satisfying?
