I started using **Linux** in April 2022 and as soon as I discovered **Tiling Window Managers** there was no way back.

After messing around with some WMs  like [**Awesome**](https://awesomewm.org/) and [**Bspwm**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bspwm) I was getting tired of copy / pasting config files and tweaking them into my needs.

That was until I discovered [**Qtile**](http://www.qtile.org/) which is fully written in **python**, main reason why I decided to stick with it since it's the language I'm most comfortable working with.

After some time and effort I created my own **Desktop Enviroment** that fullfills all my needs **just the way I want it**.

Isn't that satisfying?
